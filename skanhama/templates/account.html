        <p>SkyAnim is a website meant to enable users to share animation packages with each other even if
            some animations are locked behind a Patreon subscription or similar paywalls. That doesn't mean
            that you can download copyright-protected work. Instead, users can upload their compiled animation
            package, for example a Dynamic Animation Replacer folder, containing many different animation files from
            various sources. You can then peruse the different uploaded packages and select one you like. After you
            have found such a package.</p>
